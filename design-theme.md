# 1. Visual Identity & Color Palette

The website employs a high-contrast, modern **Dark Mode** aesthetic. This is a popular choice for fitness and martial arts brands as it evokes a sense of intensity and grit.

- **Primary Background:** Deep Black (`#000000`)
- **Accent Color:** Vibrant Neon Lime Green  
  Used strategically to draw attention to buttons, headers, and key statistics.
- **Secondary Background:** Dark Charcoal Grey for content cards to create depth
- **Imagery:**  
  The hero section uses a colorful, low-poly vector illustration, providing a unique artistic contrast to the otherwise aggressive “gym” color scheme.

## D. Conversion & Footer

# 4. Notable Observations

- **Design Consistency:**  
  The UI maintains a strong “Brand Book” feel, consistently using the same core colors and font weights.
- **Areas for Refinement:**  
  Minor typographical errors are present:
  - “MEMEBERS” in the stats bar
  - “op-notch” in the features section  

  Correcting these would further enhance the professional polish of the interface.
